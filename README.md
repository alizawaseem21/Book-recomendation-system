# Book Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to the development of a robust book recommendation system. The system leverages various machine learning techniques and algorithms to provide users with personalized book recommendations based on their preferences and past interactions.

## Features

- Utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing `user information`, `book details`, and `ratings`.
- Implements a collaborative filtering approach to suggest books based on user behavior and preferences.
- Incorporates content-based filtering to recommend books with similar attributes to those previously liked by the user.
- Implements a hybrid recommendation system that combines collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy and personalization.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Various Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook files to explore the data and models used for recommendation.
